# 🗺️ Multimodal Agent Builder - Development Roadmap

## 📌 Project Vision & Goals

The **Multimodal Agent Builder** aims to become the premier framework for building sophisticated AI agents with multimodal capabilities. Our vision is to provide developers with a seamless, production-ready platform for creating agents that can process and understand text, images, audio, and eventually video content across multiple state-of-the-art language models.

### Core Principles
- **🔌 Plug-and-Play LLM Support**: Seamless integration with OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, and future models
- **🎭 True Multimodal Understanding**: Native support for text, image, audio, and video processing
- **🏗️ Modular Architecture**: Easy to extend, customize, and scale
- **🚀 Production Ready**: Enterprise-grade reliability, monitoring, and performance
- **🧠 Adaptive Learning**: Incorporate recursive loop closure and continuous improvement mechanisms

## 📊 Current State (v0.1.0)

### ✅ Implemented Features
- **Multi-LLM Support**: Working integrations with OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini 2.5, and Anthropic Claude
- **Basic Multimodal Capabilities**: Text, image, and audio input processing
- **Agent Orchestration**: LangChain-based agent workflow management
- **REST API**: FastAPI endpoints for agent creation and invocation
- **Type Safety**: Full Pydantic validation and type hints
- **Async Architecture**: Built-in async/await support for high performance
- **Recursive Loop Closure**: Advanced training pattern recognition system
- **Narrative Enhancement**: Utilities for enriching agent responses

### 🚧 Work in Progress
- **Large Dataset Management**: Chunking system for training data (bypassing GitHub's 100MB limit)
- **Localized Narratives**: Integration of Google's localized narrative datasets
- **Training Infrastructure**: Building out training endpoints and utilities
- **Data Pipeline**: ML training/testing/validation dataset preparation
